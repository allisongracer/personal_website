I am a masters student at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at the University of California, Santa Barbara. My specializations are in Energy and Climate as well as Corporate Environmental Management. I am a passionate advocate for renewable energy and a dedicated professional with a desire to contribute towards decarbonizing the US electricity sector. I have strong interest in mitigating climate change and recognize the urgent need to transition away from fossil fuels.
