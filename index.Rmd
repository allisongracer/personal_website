I am a masters student at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management specializing in Corporate Environmental Management as well as Energy and Climate. I am passionate about sustainable energy and hope to use the tools I learn at Bren to help companies reach zero-emissions goals while maintaining economically viable business operations. In my personal time, I like to surf and boulder outdoors, always with my pup <a href="Kaya.JPG">Kaya</a> by my side.
