I graduated with honors from the University of California Santa Barbara in 2013 with a Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Studies and Anthropology with minors in Spatial Science and Native American and Indigenous Studies. I came to Bren to study Corporate Environmental Management with a focus in communication. I hope to use the tools I acquire at Bren to enable corporations to identify solutions that improve operating efficiencies that are both environmentally and economically advantageous.
